            <p>My name is Odumamwen Evans Henry Aisiokuebor alias Oducity. I was born and brought up in Nigeria and live with my family, a wife and 3 children in Benin City, Nigeria. I have worked as aluminum roof engineer in two companies for 8 years. Currently, I am working as a lead engineer in Unicon Aluminum and Solar Solutions and also happily serving as a Bishop in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I enjoy learning new things and having fun with my family.</p>
